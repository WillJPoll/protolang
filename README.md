# Protolang
## An educational, extension oriented programming language

# Design philosophy
- **Educational**
- **Extension Oriented**
  > Following along with PL's educational mandate, the compiler is being designed with extensibility in mind first and foremost in order to allow people to get a less confusing look behind the scenes then what is currently available today 
 
 # Disclaimers 
 - Protolang is by no means intended to be used professionally, I started this project because I was interested in what goes into making a programming language and also wanted to create something that could be of *some* use. This being said however, feel free to use PL in any way you see fit.
